# Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis

[Book link](https://www.amazon.com/Structured-Analytic-Techniques-Intelligence-Analysis/dp/1608710181)

## Types of analytic techniques

- Expert judgement - An expert looks at the data and writes down his conclusion
- Structured analysis - Analyst goes through a pre-defined process to rigorously reach conclusion from data
- Quantitative methods, by generating data - Using Bayesian inference, modeling, simulation etc using expert-created data
- Quantitative methods, given data - Using Bayesian inference, modeling, simulation etc on given data

Expert analysis doesn't work because humans are biased and have limited memory. That's why a structured method for analyzing intelligence is useful.

### 8 types of structured analytic techniques

- decomposition and visualization
- idea generation
- scenarios and indicators
- assessment of cause/effect
- challenge analysis
- conflict management
- hypothesis generation and testing
- decision support

## Selecting analytic techniques

### Common mistakes

- choosing techniques that fit the evidence
- avoiding techniques that take too long
- only using the techniques you know

### Core techniques

- structured brainstorming -- systematically enumerate variables, stakeholders, hypotheses, etc
- cross-impact matrix -- write down the relationship between each pair of variables
- key assumptions check -- write down and question the assumptions youâ€™re making
- indicators -- write down things to monitor (things that affect our hypothesis)
- analysis of competing hypotheses -- list all hypotheses, refute one hypothesis at a time, believe the hypothesis with the least evidence against it

### Choose a technique based on your goal

#### Get started

- Decomposition and visualization
- Idea generation

#### Make sense of data

- Decomposition and visualization
- Idea generation

#### Explain the most likely outcome of a situation

- Hypothesis generation and testing
- Assess cause/effect
- Challenge analysis

#### Monitor situation for changes

- Scenarios and indicators
- Challenge analysis

#### Generate and test hypotheses

- Hypothesis generation and testing
- Key assumptions check

#### Assess possibility of deception

- Deception detection
- Assess cause/effect
